2. **Automated Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction**
Problem: Manual crop monitoring is labor-intensive and can be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal farming decisions.

Use Case:

Overview: The AI model is used to predict the health of crops over time by monitoring the leaves and other indicators through automated imagery.
Workflow:
Continuous Monitoring: IoT sensors and drones periodically capture high-resolution images of the fields.
AI Inference: These images are processed using the leaf disease model, and any anomalies, such as discoloration or deformation of leaves, are flagged.
Predictive Analytics: Over time, the system learns patterns and predicts potential yield outcomes based on detected leaf diseases or pest infestations.
Dashboard Insights: Farmers access a dashboard where real-time crop health updates, yield predictions, and actionable suggestions are displayed.
Impact: Continuous monitoring helps farmers optimize resource usage (fertilizer, water, etc.) and improve yield forecasting, reducing waste and increasing productivity.
