3. **Infrastructure Monitoring - Cell Tower Health and Performance**
Problem: With the rapid deployment of 5G/6G networks, cell towers require constant monitoring to ensure structural integrity and performance, especially in remote locations.

Use Case:

Overview: The system automates the monitoring of cell towers by analyzing images of towers to detect physical damages, corrosion, or equipment misalignment.
Workflow:
Image Collection: Drones fly around cell towers and capture high-resolution images.
AI Inference: The images are processed using the cell towers detection model (cell-towers/1) to detect structural issues or anomalies such as rust, cracks, or bent antennas.
Edge Computing: Using 5G/6G connectivity, the data is processed on edge servers located near the towers to ensure low-latency analysis and avoid data overload on central servers.
Actionable Insights: Maintenance teams are alerted in real time if any issues are detected, and the severity of the damage is classified.
Impact: The system ensures that cell towers remain operational and structurally sound, preventing outages and costly repairs by addressing issues early.
