1. **Smart Farming - Leaf Disease Detection and Pest Control**

Problem: Farmers often face challenges in detecting early signs of crop diseases and pests, which can result in significant yield losses.

Use Case:

Overview:
The system uses AI/ML models to analyze images of crops from farms, detecting early signs of leaf diseases and pest infestations. By leveraging 5G/6G networks, real-time data can be gathered from remote areas using drones or IoT devices, enabling farmers to take action immediately.

Workflow:
Image Collection: Drones or handheld devices capture images of crops.
AI Inference: The system processes the images using the leaf disease detection model (leaf-disease-nsdsr/1) and pests detection model (pests-2xlvx/1).
5G/6G Network: Using high-speed networks, large sets of image data are transmitted to edge servers where real-time analysis is performed.
Actionable Insights: The AI models detect signs of leaf disease and pests and generate actionable reports for the farmer.
Intervention: Farmers receive notifications on mobile devices or web platforms and can immediately apply preventive measures, such as spraying pesticides or removing affected plants.
Impact: Early detection helps farmers reduce crop losses, improves yield, and reduces the costs associated with large-scale pesticide use.
