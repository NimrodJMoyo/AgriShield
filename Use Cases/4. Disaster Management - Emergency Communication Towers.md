4. **Disaster Management - Emergency Communication Towers**
Problem: After natural disasters, communication towers are often damaged, causing significant delays in emergency response efforts.

Use Case:

Overview: The system is deployed to quickly assess the structural integrity of emergency communication towers after disasters like earthquakes or storms, allowing for fast repair prioritization and deployment of mobile units if necessary.
Workflow:
Post-Disaster Data Collection: Drones survey damaged areas, capturing images of communication towers.
AI Inference: The images are processed using the cell towers model to detect structural damage.
Real-Time Alerts: The system automatically prioritizes towers needing immediate repair to restore communication in affected areas.
Impact: This use case supports faster restoration of communication lines in disaster-stricken areas, helping coordinate rescue and relief efforts.
