7. **Real-Time Crop Insurance Verification**
Problem: Crop insurance verification can be a lengthy process, delaying payouts to farmers in times of crisis.

Use Case:

Overview: The system uses drone imagery and AI to provide real-time verification of crop damage after natural disasters or disease outbreaks.
Workflow:
Data Collection: Drones capture images of the affected crops.
AI Inference: The leaf disease and pest detection models analyze the images to quantify the extent of the damage.
Real-Time Reports: The system generates reports that can be shared with insurance companies, reducing the time for claim verification.
Impact: Farmers receive faster compensation from insurance claims, helping them recover quickly from disasters or crop failures.
